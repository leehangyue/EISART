# About
 EISART is a fast impedance spectrum analysis tool originally developed for solid oxide fuel cells.
 It features one-click operations for:
 · Distribution of Relaxation Time (DRT) analysis
 · Auto or semi-auto Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM) fitting & ZView *.mdl model importing/exporting
 · Batch processing and easy-to-use saving format
 EISART is robust to noise, wiring induction, and deviated data points in EIS. It visualizes the original data and the fitting result as  Nyquist and Bode plots, and shows the fitting residuals to the user in real time.

 For more details of EISART, please refer to the user manual file (pdf).
